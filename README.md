### Synopsis:
On October 15, 2015, FiveThirtyEight pulished an article, ["Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandangoâ€™s"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) , which in detail compares the star rating system of Fandango to other popular websites, like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and MetaCritic.  
In this repo, which is a part of @Pierian-Data's Machine Learning Bootcamp, I analyzed the [data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango) provided by @fivethirtyeight to answer this question: **Can websites that both rate movies and sell ticket can be trusted, specifically Fandango?**
